SMTextei-P5
===========

SMTextei-P5 is a text-based game based on Persona 5.

This project is for fun only and won't be commercialized. I got some of the game's information like battle system, MC activities, and the story itself by playing the actual game.

I won't give the game's story for those who never played the game, and will delete this repo if Atlus tells me to do so.
Feel free to contribute and give some suggestions.
